Start by installing all the necessary libraries and plug in a camera. By running the program, two windows should pop-up: depth map and Yolov8 output screen. Click on any detected object in the Yolov8 output screen to open two more windows of the cropped original image and the cropped depth map of the object. Additionally, an additional window will pop-up with an interactive 3D model of the scene in front of the camera. Close the interactive 3D model window to continue the program.  

The first time you run this program, files will automatically download and take a while.
